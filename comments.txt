If you want to run opencv on heroku:

You have to install some dependencies, as Heroku will not automatically do it for you.

Add an Aptfile in your project directory and add the below file
libsm6

libxrender1

libfontconfig1

libice6

NOTE: Aptfile should not have any .txt or any other extension. Just like the Procfile

Push the edited code to Github

In heroku dashboard,
goto your-app --> settings --> buildpacks --> add buildpacks --> https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt.git
copy and paste this link --> add buildpack

Deploy your app
